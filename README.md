# umbrella

A service that tells you if you should take an umbrella, based on location and time spent.

I created this during [Mozilla Festival 2014](http://2014.mozillafestival.org/) while playing around with [Met Office Datapoint](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint) and the [datapoint-python](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson/datapoint-python) library.
